# cryptoPals

This repository contains my solutions to the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges. The cryptopals challenges are a set of exercises that take you through the process of breaking cryptographic systems. The challenges are designed to be solved in order, as each one builds on the previous.

## Set 1: Basics
01. base64.js
02. xorBuffer.js
03. unXor.js
04. detectXor.js
05. repeatingXor.js
